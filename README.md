# TinyML-Exercises  

## Description  
TinyML projects. Project 1 is a trivial example of training a model to predict the outputs of a NAND gate.  
The model is trained using ``tensorflow`` in ``Google Colab`` and converted to C code which is executed on an  
ESP32 module. The EloquentTinyML library is used to run the inference on the ESP32.
